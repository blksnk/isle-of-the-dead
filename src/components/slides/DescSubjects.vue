    <p>Desolate and rocky islet seen across an expanse of water. A small rowing boat is heading for the watergate and seawall on the island.</p>
    <p>On the boat, an oarsman rows the boat from the stern. In the bow, facing the island is a standing figure clad in white. In front of the white figure, is a white, festooned coffin</p>
    <p>The center of the tiny island is dominated by a grove of tall, dark cypress trees, which are tightly hemmed in by cliffs.</p>
    <p>Cypress trees are associated with cemeteries and mourning. Furthermore, the inner rock cliff faces appear to be tomb or interment portals.</p>
